SYSTEM_MSG = """
You are a code architect that will help me design a system in multiple phases.
I will provide you the API specification and system guarantees.

From there, we will have two kinds of implementations:
- A basic implementation that fulfills the guarantees, is very simple, but may be inefficient.
    * It can have simple algorithms (e.g., linear, O(n^2) or even worse).
    * It can have coarse-grained global locks and sequentialize every operation.
    * It can do coarse-grained file/network I/O without complex file reorganization or protocols.
    * It can have the crudest form of durability and recovery (e.g., full rewrites/rereads).
    * But it should be correct and fulfill the guarantees.
- An advanced implementation that is efficient, concurrent and safe.

Each implementation will be broken down into multiple steps.
- First, we will come up with an implementation plan which will be a high-level description of the steps.
- Then, we will implement each step in a separate function.

For now, our implementations will be high-level and language-agnostic.
We will later concretize them in many target languages once I am certain of the design.
"""

GENERAL_CODING_GUIDELINES = """
# General Coding Guidelines
Even though we are using Python to ground the implementation, I want a language-agnostic solution that can be implemented in any language.

When creating variables, you can use Python's types and standard library.
- For example, you can use `t.List[int]` to denote a list of integers.
- Or `t.IO` to denote a file object.
- Or `t.Optional` to denote an optional value.
- Or `t.Dict` to denote a dictionary.
- Or `threading.Lock` to denote a lock.
- Or `bytes` to denote a byte vector.
- Feel free to import `typing as t` to make the type hints cleaner.

Likewise, use Python's variable/class/function/method definitions and syntax.
- For example, you can use `def` to define a function.
- Also, arithmetic operations, control-flow operations, function calls, etc. can be in Python.
    - That's because these can easily be translated to any language.

However, minimize reliance on Python-specific features to keep language agnostism.
- I want you to assume that there exists a function call `assistant_codegen("high-level english")` and can generate code in any language as long as the high-level English is not too complex.
    * For example:
        - Instead using python's sorting, you can do `sorted_list = assistant_codegen("sort the list", list_to_sort)`.
        - Instead of using low-level I/O operations, you can do `file = assistant_codegen("open the file in RW Mode", filename)` or `assistant_codegen("write to the file at the given offset", file, offset, data)`.
    * It cannot, however, do extremely complex/multstep tasks like:
        - `assistant_codegen("Building a full OS from scratch") or `assistant_codegen("a full Python interpreter")`.
        - `assistant_codegen("Call a Lambda function, then Insert in DynamoDB, then Write to S3 and notify the a REST API")`.
            -  This can however be broken down into multiple steps:
                - `value = assistant_codegen("Call a Lambda function and parse its output from json", lambda_name, lambda_args)`.
                - `assistant_codegen("Insert in DynamoDB. Throw an exception if failure.", key, value)`.
                - `success = assistant_codegen("Write to S3. Return a boolean marking success.", data)`.
                - `assistant_codegen("Notify the a REST API. Ignore output/error.", endpoint, success)`.
- Assume any library the assistant needs is already available.

As an example, here is code than returns the value at a given percentile in a list of integers:
```python
# Use python syntax and type hints for declarations.
def percentile(lst: t.List[int], p: float) -> int:
    # Use codegen for sorting.
    sorted_list: t.List[int] = assistant_codegen("sort the list", lst)
    # Use python for regular operations and common operations (e.g., length, indexing).
    index: int = int(len(sorted_list) * p)
    return sorted_list[index]
```
"""

IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Create an implementation plan for the basic implementation.
The steps should be high-level, unless there is something extremely specific and complex that requires pseudo-code.

Your output should be formatted as follows:

<reason>
```md
... Overall reasoning for the plan here ...
```
</reason>

<plan>
```md
... High-level steps for the plan here ...
```
</plan>

Be sure to respect the tags (reason, plan) and the markdown formatting.

TOML_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_INSTRUCTIONS = """
I now have the implementation. Convert it to an easy-to-parse and easy-to-understand TOML format.
I have automated tools that rely on well-generated TOML files, so please ensure the output is correct and complete.

Your output should be formatted as follows:

<plan>
```toml
[[method]]
class_name = "class_name"|"" # If the method is in a class (i.e. not an outer function)
class_interface = "interface_name"|"" # If the class implements an interface
method_name = "method_name"|"function_name"

[[method]]

</plan>

METHOD_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Implement the method given the overall plan.
We will implement one method at a time, but you can see the overall plan for context.

Your output should be formatted as follows:

<reason>

```
</reason>

<code>
```python
class ClassName(...):
    # ... Imports here ...
    def method_name(self, ...):
        # ... Implementation here ...
```
</code>


For my own convenience:
- Define the method inside the class so that I can easily merge it with the existing code.
- Place the import inside the class definition (for dynamic loading to work).
- Be sure to use `assistant_codegen` whenever possible to keep the code mostly high-level and language-agnostic.
    - Remember to break down complex tasks into multiple steps, each calling `assistant_codegen` if possible.
    - Simple operations like arithmetic, control-flow, basic function calls, object creation, etc. can be in Python.
    - Likewise types can be Python types (e.g., `t.List[int]`).
- Be as explicit about the types of class members, method arguments, and return values as possible.
    - You can be less strict for local variables if the type is obvious from the context.
