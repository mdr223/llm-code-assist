# Implementation Essentials

## In-Memory State
- A page table map from page number to page.
- A pinned map from page number to number of pins.
- The unpinned set is tracked by the replacement policy.


## Disk State
- Pages are stored in the given file, at the offset page_num * page_size.
- Assume the page_size is small-enough for atomic writes to disk.
- The file is opened in binary RW mode.
- Dirty pages are written back when:
    (1) Evicted from a full buffer manager.
    (2) Explicitly flushed to disk.

## Operations
- Pinning a page:
    - If a page is already in memory, increment the pin count and return the page.
    - If a page is not in memory, read it from disk, add it to the page table and pinned map, and return the page.
    - If the buffer manager is full, evict a page using the replacement policy.
- Unpinning a page:
    - Decrement the pin count.
    - If the pin count reaches 0:
        - Erase the page number from the pinned map.
        - Move the page to the replacement policy.
- Eviction and Flushing a page:
    - Just write the page to disk if it is dirty.
    - Be sure to update the file size if the page number is out of bounds.
- Creating a page:
    - Just create the page in memory and pin it.
    - No need to write to disk immediately.
