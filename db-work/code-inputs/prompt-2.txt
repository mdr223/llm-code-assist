You are an intelligent agent tasked with generating code patches for a code base in order to implement a user request.

The system is divided into two parts:
- the system software, which contains the actual source code files (written in Rust)
- the system documentation, which describes the purpose and desired implementation of the source code

Your job is to generate code patches for files in the code base which do one or more of the following:
- create new code in one or more existing files
- delete code from one or more existing file

Your objective is to produce a valid code patch which can be applied directly to the file(s) you specify.

RELEVANT SYSTEM DOCS
--------------------
system-docs/storage-overview.md
-----
The storage layer is implemented in `rustdb/src/storage/` and contains the following files:

`mod.rs`
-----
This file implements the base interface for all access methods. It contains a struct for a `HeapFile` which has abstract methods for:
- `readPage(pageNo)`: reading the specified page
- `insertTuple(tuple)`: inserting a tuple into the heap file
- `deleteTuple(tuple)`: deleting a tuple from the heap file
- `flushPage(page)`: flushing a page to the storage backend
- `iterator()`: iterator for reading all tuples in the heap file

`file_store.rs`
-----
This file implements the interface defined in `mod.rs` for the local disk access method. This file contains an implementation of the `HeapFile` struct -- and its abstract methods -- assuming a local disk storage backend.

`tuple.rs`
-----
This file contains the definition and implementation of tuples in the database system. It defines a `Tuple` struct which has:
- a record id (a tuple specifying the page number and position the tuple was read from)
- a list of fields
Each field in the `Tuple` may be an Integer or a String.

system-docs/system-overview.md
-----
This system implements a database in Rust.

The database is implemented in the `rustdb/` directory.

MODULES
-----
The database currently has the following modules:
- **Storage Layer:** implemented in `rustdb/src/storage/` which contains the following files
  - `mod.rs`: the base interface for the storage layer; different access methods overwrite its core functionalities
  - `file_store.rs`: the access method which implements the storage layer in `mod.rs` using files on local disk
  - `tuple.rs`: a file containing the definition and implementation of tuples in the database system

USER REQUEST
------------
Please write some code which can go into the main() function of main.rs which constructs two tuples and inserts them into a heap file using the HeapFile implementation in file_store.rs.
