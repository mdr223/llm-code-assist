When compiling the Rust project I ran into the following error:

error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.file` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/storage/file_store.rs:22:9
   |
22 |         self.file.seek(SeekFrom::Start((page_no * 4096) as u64))?;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
   |

error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.file` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/storage/file_store.rs:23:9
   |
23 |         self.file.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
   |

What should I do to resolve this issue?
