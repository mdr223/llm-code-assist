To fulfill your request, I'll create a code patch for the `main.rs` file to construct two tuples and insert them into a heap file using the `HeapFile` implementation from `file_store.rs`. Here's the code patch:

```rust
--- a/rustdb/src/main.rs
+++ b/rustdb/src/main.rs
@@ -1,3 +1,30 @@
+use crate::storage::file_store::FileHeapFile;
+use crate::storage::tuple::{Tuple, Field};
+use crate::storage::HeapFile;
+
 fn main() {
-    println!("Hello, world!");
+    // Create a new heap file
+    let mut heap_file = FileHeapFile::new("test_heap_file.dat").expect("Failed to create heap file");
+
+    // Create the first tuple
+    let tuple1 = Tuple::new(vec![
+        Field::Integer(42),
+        Field::String("Hello, World!".to_string()),
+    ]);
+
+    // Create the second tuple
+    let tuple2 = Tuple::new(vec![
+        Field::Integer(100),
+        Field::String("RustDB".to_string()),
+    ]);
+
+    // Insert the tuples into the heap file
+    heap_file.insert_tuple(&tuple1).expect("Failed to insert tuple1");
+    heap_file.insert_tuple(&tuple2).expect("Failed to insert tuple2");
+
+    println!("Inserted two tuples into the heap file.");
+
+    // Optional: Read back the tuples to verify insertion
+    // This part would require implementing an iterator for the heap file
+    // and is not included in the current implementation.
 }
```

This code patch does the following:

1. Imports the necessary modules and structs from the storage layer.
2. Creates a new `FileHeapFile` instance, which implements the `HeapFile` trait.
3. Constructs two `Tuple` instances with different fields (an integer and a string for each).
4. Inserts both tuples into the heap file using the `insert_tuple` method.
5. Prints a confirmation message.

Note that this code assumes:
- The `FileHeapFile` struct in `file_store.rs` implements the `HeapFile` trait and has a `new` method that takes a file name.
- The `Tuple` struct in `tuple.rs` has a `new` method that takes a vector of `Field` enum values.
- The `Field` enum in `tuple.rs` has variants for `Integer` and `String`.

You may need to adjust the import statements or struct/method names if they differ in your actual implementation.

To apply this patch, you would save it to a file (e.g., `main_patch.diff`) and then use a patching tool or manually edit the `main.rs` file to incorporate these changes.
