The error messages indicate that there is a conflict between the `Tuple` struct defined in `rustdb/src/storage/mod.rs` and the `Tuple` struct defined in `rustdb/src/storage/tuple.rs`. To resolve this, we should ensure that only one `Tuple` definition is used and remove or replace the conflicting definition.

Given the context, it seems that the `Tuple` struct in `rustdb/src/storage/tuple.rs` is the actual implementation and the definition in `rustdb/src/storage/mod.rs` should be removed.

Here's the code patch to resolve the issue:

```

This code patch does the following:
1. Removes the conflicting `Tuple` struct definition from `rustdb/src/storage/mod.rs`.
2. Adjusts the `main.rs` import, ensuring that all `Tuple` references use the `rustdb/src/storage/tuple.rs` definition.

After applying this patch, the code should compile correctly without the type mismatch errors.
