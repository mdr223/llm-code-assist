To resolve the issue of the Rust compiler not being able to locate the `storage` module in the crate root, you need to ensure that the `storage` module is properly declared and can be found in the project structure. This involves making sure that `mod storage;` is declared in the `lib.rs` file if your project has one, or directly in the `main.rs` file if your project is a binary crate.

Here is the patch to your `main.rs` file:

1. Open `rustdb/src/main.rs` file.
2. Add the `mod storage;` declaration at the top of `main.rs`.

### Patch

```rust
// rustdb/src/main.rs

// Declare the storage module
mod storage;

use crate::storage::file_store::FileHeapFile;
use crate::storage::tuple::{Tuple, Field};
use crate::storage::HeapFile;

fn main() {
    // Your main function code here
}
```

Additionally, if your project has a `lib.rs` file (common for library crates), you should add the `mod storage;` declaration there instead. Here is an example:

```rust
// rustdb/src/lib.rs

// Declare the storage module
pub mod storage;

// Re-export storage components if needed
pub use crate::storage::file_store::FileHeapFile;
pub use crate::storage::tuple::{Tuple, Field};
pub use crate::storage::HeapFile;
```

By applying these patches, you will make sure that the `storage` module is declared and accessible, allowing the Rust compiler to resolve the imports successfully.
