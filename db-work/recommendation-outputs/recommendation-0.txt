### Recommendations for Adding an Initial Storage Layer to the Database
#### 1. System Software Changes
**1.1 Creation of New Modules:**
   - **`storage` module**: Create a dedicated module for handling the storage layer.
     - **Purpose**: This module will be responsible for data organization, reading, and writing to disk.
**1.2 Creation of New Files:**
   - **`rustdb/storage/mod.rs`**:
     - **Purpose**: Serve as the entry point of the storage module.
     - **Implementation**:
       - Define the core traits and structures necessary for the storage operations.
       - Include basic functionalities like read, write, and initialization of the storage layer.
     
   - **`rustdb/storage/file_store.rs`**:
     - **Purpose**: Implement file-based storage.
     - **Implementation**:
       - Implement functionalities to read from and write to files on disk.
       - Handle file-based operations like opening, closing, and managing file pointers.
**1.3 Refactoring:**
   - Update the main `lib.rs` or `main.rs` file in `rustdb` to include and initialize the new storage module.
#### 2. System Documentation Changes
**2.1 Editing Existing Documentation:**
   - **Edit `system-docs/system-overview.md`**:
     - **Purpose**: Update the system overview to include the new storage layer.
     - **New Content**:
       - Add a section that describes the purpose of the storage module.
       - Outline the key functionalities provided by the storage layer.
       - Include brief descriptions of newly created files and modules.
**2.2 Creation of New Documentation Pages:**
   - **`system-docs/storage-overview.md`**:
     - **Purpose**: Provide a detailed overview of the storage module.
     - **Content**:
       - Explain the architecture of the storage module.
       - Detail the key components and their roles, such as `mod.rs` and `file_store.rs`.
       - Describe the interactions between different components.
       - Include code snippets and usage examples for developers.
#### 3. High-Level Implementation Plan
1. **Design Storage Module**:
   - Draft a plan for the storage module, defining required traits and structures.
   - Decide on file storage strategies (e.g., fixed-size blocks, dynamically sized records).
2. **Create Core Files**:
   - Implement `mod.rs` to define the interface and basic operations.
   - Implement `file_store.rs` to handle file-based storage operations.
3. **Update Main Application**:
   - Modify `lib.rs` or `main.rs` to use the storage module appropriately.
   - Ensure the main application initializes the storage layer during startup.
4. **Document the Changes**:
   - Update `system-overview.md` to reflect the new architecture.
   - Create `storage-overview.md` to provide detailed documentation on the storage module.
#### 4. Summary
By creating a new `storage` module and associated files like `mod.rs` and `file_store.rs`, and by updating and expanding system documentation, we can effectively add an initial storage layer to the database. This will set the groundwork for more advanced features and ensure that developers understand the purpose and usage of the new storage layer.
