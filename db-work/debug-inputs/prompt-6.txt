You are an intelligent agent tasked with debugging code and compilation errors for a code base.

The system is divided into two parts:
- the system software, which contains the actual source code files (written in Rust)
- the system documentation, which describes the purpose and desired implementation of the source code

Your job is to debug code and/or compilation errors and suggest fixes to the code base which do one or more of the following:
- create new code in one or more existing files
- edit code in one or more existing files
- delete code from one or more existing files

Your objective is to produce a valid code patch which can be applied directly to the file(s) you specify.

RELEVANT SYSTEM DOCS
--------------------
system-docs/storage-overview.md
-----
The storage layer is implemented in `rustdb/src/storage/` and contains the following files:

`mod.rs`
-----
This file implements the base interface for all access methods. It contains a struct for a `HeapFile` which has abstract methods for:
- `readPage(pageNo)`: reading the specified page
- `insertTuple(tuple)`: inserting a tuple into the heap file
- `deleteTuple(tuple)`: deleting a tuple from the heap file
- `flushPage(page)`: flushing a page to the storage backend
- `iterator()`: iterator for reading all tuples in the heap file

`file_store.rs`
-----
This file implements the interface defined in `mod.rs` for the local disk access method. This file contains an implementation of the `HeapFile` struct -- and its abstract methods -- assuming a local disk storage backend.

`tuple.rs`
-----
This file contains the definition and implementation of tuples in the database system. It defines a `Tuple` struct which has:
- a record id (a tuple specifying the page number and position the tuple was read from)
- a list of fields
Each field in the `Tuple` may be an Integer or a String.

system-docs/system-overview.md
-----
This system implements a database in Rust.

The database is implemented in the `rustdb/` directory.

MODULES
-----
The database currently has the following modules:
- **Storage Layer:** implemented in `rustdb/src/storage/` which contains the following files
  - `mod.rs`: the base interface for the storage layer; different access methods overwrite its core functionalities
  - `file_store.rs`: the access method which implements the storage layer in `mod.rs` using files on local disk
  - `tuple.rs`: a file containing the definition and implementation of tuples in the database system

USER REQUEST
------------
When compiling the Rust project I ran into the following error:

error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.file` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/storage/file_store.rs:22:9
   |
22 |         self.file.seek(SeekFrom::Start((page_no * 4096) as u64))?;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
   |

error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.file` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/storage/file_store.rs:23:9
   |
23 |         self.file.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
   |

What should I do to resolve this issue?
